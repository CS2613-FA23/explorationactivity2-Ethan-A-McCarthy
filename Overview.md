The expirience with this package was very smooth as setting it up takes very little time and effort, and learning it was similar to learning functional based programming with a bit of HTML on the side.

Yes i would but only if I planned to do something much bigger. There are already many graph making softwares out there so what i made could be made much easier with other tools. However it is compatible with many website framworks and can be used on the web very quickly so it has its benefits.
