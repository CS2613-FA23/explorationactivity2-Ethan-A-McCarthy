# ExplorationActivity2
## 1 Package:
I chose the chartjs package for javascript and this program demonstrates some of the capabilities of chartjs by letting the user create some graphs that chartjs offers. ChartJS is very good for data visualization and has many different options to show data using javascript.
## 2 How do you run this program? 
To run this program you have to have both the chartJS.js script and the index.html files downloaded. Then you open the html file with a web browser of your choosing. Then you select what kind of chart you want and then input the title and data for the graph. To create a new graph you reload the page and change the values.
## 3 What is the purpose of the program?
The purpose of this program is to create graphs to represent data and show them.
## 4 Sample input/output:
To input the title of the chart you enter the title in the text box. To select the type of graph select it from the drop down. For a pie/bar chart you input the label of the bar and then its value seperated by a comma and the different bars seperated by spaces Ex:(France,5 United-States,10 Canada,7). For a line/scatter graph you label the x and y axes by typing in the text boxes. To input the data you input the x and y values of the point seperated by a comma and the points seperated by spaces Ex:(1,1 2,2 3,3)
